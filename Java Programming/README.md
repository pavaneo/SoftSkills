In Compilation Time:

        - Source code (xyz.java) this will goes to compiler (which is inside JDK)
        - Then compiler will convert this to byte code (xyz.class)
        - and this can be run in any machine (Mac / Windows)
        
        
In Execution Time:

        - By using Byte code(xyz.class) JVM will convert this to native code (Machine Understading language)
